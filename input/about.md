Title: About
---
My name is Junvic, and I run [InstilledBee's Studio](http://instilledbee.net) and [The Ultimate Nerd](https://instilledbee.net/blog) (this blog). I run these websites to host my programming endeavours and side projects outside of work. I'm mainly a .NET developer by day, but I dabble in web technologies, game development (e.g. game jams) in my spare time. Aside posting stuff in InstilledBee's Studio, I also open source some of my projects and can be found in [Github](https://github.com/instilledbee).

If you want to keep posted on new stuff I work on, feel free to subscribe to this blog, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/InstilledBee),, or like my [Facebook page](https://fb.com/ibeestudio).
